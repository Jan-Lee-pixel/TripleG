3. SYSTEM-WIDE RISKS & MITIGATION

| Risk Area                   | Description                                                                 | Mitigation Strategies                                   |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Security                    | XSS, CSRF, SQL Injection, weak auth, data leaks, CORS issues.                | Use Django/JS security features, strong auth, CORS config, HTTPS, sanitize input, regular updates. |
| Scalability/Performance     | High user load, slow queries, frontend bundle size, chat scaling.            | Optimize DB queries, use CDN/caching, code splitting, async for chat, load testing. |
| Data Integrity              | Data loss/corruption in diaries, blogs, portfolios.                          | Migrations, DB backups, transaction management, frontend validation. |
| Integration (API/Realtime)  | API version mismatch, websocket reliability, CORS, async bugs.               | API versioning, thorough frontend-backend testing, fallback to polling, CORS policy review. |
| Admin & Permissions         | Incorrect access control, privilege escalation, admin panel exposure.         | Django permissions/groups, frontend role checks, restrict admin URLs, test all roles. |
| Third-Party Dependencies    | Library/API failures, outdated packages, hosting provider downtime.           | Pin dependencies, monitor CVEs, regular updates, multi-provider fallback plan. |
| File/Media Handling         | File upload vulnerabilities, storage issues, CDN config.                      | Validate uploads, secure storage, limit file types/sizes, use CDN for media. |
| Deployment/Hosting          | DNS misconfig, SSL issues, build/deploy failures, downtime.                   | Use CI/CD, monitor deploys, automate SSL, test with staging, use status pages. |
| User Experience             | Inconsistent UI, slow load, mobile issues, error feedback.                    | Responsive design, UX testing, error boundaries, user feedback loop. |

4. MITIGATION STRATEGIES (Full System)
- Use Django and frontend framework security best practices (CSRF, XSS, auth, CORS).
- Implement role-based access and permissions in both backend and frontend.
- Use CI/CD for automated testing and deployment (Netlify for frontend, Render for backend).
- Enable monitoring/logging for backend (Render) and frontend (Netlify analytics).
- Regularly update all dependencies and frameworks.
- Use HTTPS everywhere; automate SSL cert renewals (GoDaddy/Netlify/Render).
- Use CDN for static/media files to improve speed and reliability.
- Test deployment on all platforms (GoDaddy DNS, Netlify, Render) before production.
- Document all APIs, deployment steps, and admin workflows.
- Provide user/admin training and clear support channels.

5. ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS
- Schedule regular security audits and penetration tests.
- Set up automated backups and test recovery procedures.
- Monitor hosting provider status and plan for failover if needed.
- Collect user feedback after launch for continuous improvement.
