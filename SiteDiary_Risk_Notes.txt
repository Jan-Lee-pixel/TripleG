SiteDiary Risk and Mitigation Notes
==================================

1. Interconnected Functionality
Each sub-feature (new entry, dashboard, history, reports, admin management) isn’t isolated—they interact with each other. For example, a new diary entry affects the dashboard, history, and reports. This means changes in one area can cause unexpected issues in others.

2. Data Flow and Integrity
Data must move smoothly between sub-features. For example, when an entry is created or edited, it needs to appear correctly in history, reports, and admin views. Ensuring this consistency is challenging, especially as the system grows.

3. Different User Roles and Permissions
Admin management adds layers of permissions and controls. You need to ensure regular users can only access their own diaries, while admins can manage or audit all diaries. Managing these permissions securely increases complexity.

4. Advanced Features Like Reporting
Reports often require aggregating and analyzing data across many entries, sometimes with filters or custom views. This requires more advanced logic and testing.

5. Error Handling and Edge Cases
With more features, there are more chances for bugs, edge cases, and unexpected user actions. For example, what happens if a diary entry is deleted? How does that affect reports and history?

6. UI/UX Complexity
The interface must support all these features in a way that’s clear and easy to use, which is harder as more features are added.

Mitigation Strategies
---------------------
- Use robust database transactions and validation to maintain data integrity.
    - **Explanation:** Database transactions ensure that changes to data are completed fully and correctly, or not at all. Validation checks prevent bad or incomplete data from being saved, reducing the risk of errors or corruption.
- Start with core diary features, add reporting/admin last to reduce initial complexity.
    - **Explanation:** Building the basic diary functions first allows you to focus on the most important parts and make sure they work well before adding more complex features like reports or admin tools.
- Regular backups and audit logs to prevent and track data loss or corruption.
    - **Explanation:** Backups protect your data in case something goes wrong, and audit logs help you trace what happened if there is an issue, making it easier to recover or fix problems.
- User acceptance testing for workflows to catch issues early.
    - **Explanation:** Testing the system with real users helps you find problems or confusing parts before launch, so you can fix them early and improve the user experience.
- Implement clear user/admin role separation and test permissions.
    - **Explanation:** Separating regular user and admin features, and testing permissions, ensures that users only access what they should, improving security and reducing mistakes.
- Modularize code and design for easier maintenance and testing.
    - **Explanation:** Breaking the code into smaller, independent modules makes it easier to update, fix, and test different parts of the system without affecting everything else.
